Lets you create a content inventory, marking content as redundant/outdated/trivial, assigning content owners, and storing notes. The IDs are revealed on the Edit screens so you can keep track of your content even if you change titles and permalinks.

You can display the inventory details to logged-in editors on the front end if you want.

Supports custom post types.
