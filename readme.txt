Lets you create a content inventory right in the WordPress Edit screens. You can mark content as redundant, outdated, trivial, or in need of a review.

== Description ==

Lets you create a content inventory right in the WordPress Edit screens, similar to the process you might use to assess your site's content in a spreadsheet. You can mark content as redundant, outdated, trivial, or in need of a review for SEO or style. These content status labels work just like categories, so you can remove the built-in ones and add your own if you like. You can also assign a content owner (distinct from the original author) and keep internal notes. The IDs are revealed on the Edit screens so you can keep track of your content even if you change titles and permalinks. The plugin supports custom post types as well as posts, pages, and media files.

There's an Overview report under the Dashboard menu that shows you which posts/pages/attachments/etc. need attention, sorted by user. This screen also lets you export a CSV file of the audit report.

The plugin creates three new filters on the Edit screens: author, content owner, and content status. This should make it easy to narrow your focus to just a few pages at a time.

You can display the audit details to logged-in editors on the front end if you want, either above or below the content. You can style the audit message with custom CSS.

If you want to see sparklines from Google Analytics, also install the <a href="http://www.ioncannon.net/projects/google-analytics-dashboard-wordpress-widget/">Google Analytics Dashboard plugin</a>. This will give you some idea of how popular an article is, which might influence your decisions.

<strong>New:</strong> you can now clear data from past audits and start over!

== Upgrade Notice ==

= 1.7 =
New: an option to clear data from previous audits and start over.

== Changelog ==

= 1.8 =
* Better CSV export.
= 1.7 =
* New option to delete information from previous content audits and start over. The audit attribute terms themselves are preserved and can be reused, but they will no longer be assigned to posts/pages.
* Term descriptions added to the default audit attributes. Thanks to @garyj for the suggestion.
* Removed old media attachment fields to edit, which were duplicated now that attachments use post.php.

* Audit attribute (term) counts are now totaled per post type. Under 'Pages,' the Content Audit terms' page counts show only pages, not the cumulative number of posts across all post types (which is the WordPress default for counting term totals, and is what was shown in older versions). For cumulative totals, see the top of the Overview screen.

* Supports custom roles.
* Added "audited" status to the default list, to be used when the audit for that item is complete. This can be removed.
